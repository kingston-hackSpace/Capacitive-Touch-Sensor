<h1>Touch Sensor</h1>

<p>This breakout board is the simplest way to create a project with a single “momentary” touch sensor. When a capacitive load is detected (e.g. a person touches the sensor-pad area) the red LED lights up and the output pin goes high. You can also solder a wire to the middle pad and create your own capacitive pad if the built-in one isn’t suited to your project. However for additional contacts, I would suggest using copper foil, and then solder a wire that connects from the foil pad to the breakout.</p>
